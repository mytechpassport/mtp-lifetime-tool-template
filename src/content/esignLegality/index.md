# My Tech Passport E-sign Legality Statement

## ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES ARE LEGAL‍

My Tech Passport E-sign provides you with a legally binding eSignature solution for your contract needs. My Tech Passport E-sign complies with the requirements of the U.S. Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act of 2000 (ESIGN), the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), and the European Union eIDAS (EU No.910/2014) regarding electronic signatures and transmissions, thus making eSignatures fast, easy, and legally binding.

Electronic signatures are valid and legally binding in a majority of countries around the world. Most countries have realized how burdensome ink signatures have become in our fast-paced and globalized economy: ink signatures slow down the contracting process and create a paper management problem.

When selecting an eSignature provider, consider:**‍‍**

## SIGNATURE AUTHENTICATION‍

My Tech Passport E-sign authenticates document signers so you know who is signing your documents. Any person signing a document via My Tech Passport E-sign must either have login information for My Tech Passport E-sign, or have received in their email account a request for signature. To protect My Tech Passport E-sign user accounts, all user information transferred is protected by 128-bit or higher Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, including usernames and passwords. We also seek to prevent others from accessing or using your account by imposing automated session time-outs, and emailing you every time a document is sent to, received by, or signed under your account.

## ‍SIGNATURE AFFIXATION‍

Each signature on a document is imposed and affixed to the document. When you request a signature, My Tech Passport E-sign affixes an audit trail cover page to the document itself. The audit trail contains a globally unique identifier, or GUID, that can be used to look up a record in our database, which shows who signed a document and when they signed it.

## DOCUMENT AUTHENTICITY‍

My Tech Passport E-sign is designed to keep your documents secure and prevent tampering during and after the signing process. Utilizing hashing technology, My Tech Passport E-sign creates a unique record of the underlying document before either party signs it and then creates a separate unique record of the underlying document that contains all of the signatures. If you ever need to prove there was no tampering between the pre and post-signed documents, My Tech Passport E-sign can provide you with the two unique document records. My Tech Passport E-sign utilizes the same technology to help protect your eSignatures.

## AUDIT TRAILS‍

My Tech Passport E-sign creates a comprehensive audit trail between signing parties. To provide you with a transaction history, we track and timestamp various information from the moment the document is submitted for signature to when it is completely signed and secured, such as IP information and UserAgent information. To help ensure that any tampering of the audit trail is detectable, we process the audit trail with hashing technology. Should you ever need to rely on an audit trail, we are right by your side to assist you.

## SECURE RECORDS‍

We take information security seriously, which is why sensitive communications with My Tech Passport E-sign are protected with SSL encryption. Additionally, we encrypt all of your statically-stored files and signature information in Amazon's S3 servers, which are housed in an ISO 27001 certified data center, and restrict physical and employee access to it.

## ACCESIBLE SOLUTION‍

My Tech Passport E-sign is a universally accessible solution, as only an Internet connection and a major web browser is required to sign a document. This means that just about anybody you request a signature from can access and sign the documents you send them. You can also easily download and access documents that are processed through My Tech Passport E-sign, as we provide all documents in PDF format.

My Tech Passport E-sign looks forward to being your eSignature solution and providing you with the most user friendly platform available.
