## Overview of eSignature Legality in Japan

Japan has legally recognized electronic signatures since 2000 with the Electronic Signatures and Certification Business Act.

‍

### Electronic Signature Law

[Electronic Signatures and Certification Business Act](https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/Resources/Legislation/eSignLaw/eSignLaw.pdf) promotes the use of electronic signatures to improve the national economy and citizens’ quality of life. eSignatures are authorized by the electronic records and accreditation system that are necessary.

‍

### Are eSignatures legal, admissible, and enforceable?

Yes.

‍

### Summary of Law

An eSignature is broadly defined as “a record that is prepared by an electronic form, a magnetic form or any other form not perceivable by human senses and that is used for information processing by computers”.

‍

Some attributes of an e-signature:

- Should be identified as created by the person who is requiring an eSignature
- Any alteration to the information is detectable
- The term “Certification Business” means that the person who requests a signature certifies that the document signed can be accepted with eSignature from both parties

Japan's tiered eSignature laws recognize standard eSignatures as legal and enforceable while giving digital signatures the same legal status as handwritten signatures.

‍

### Key Restrictions

According to the Electronic Signatures and Certification Business Act, eSignatures shall not apply to the following transactions or documents:

- Government transactions
- Notarizations
- Wills
- Real estate property transactions
