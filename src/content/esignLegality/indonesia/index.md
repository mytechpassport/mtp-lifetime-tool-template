## Overview of eSignature Legality in Indonesia

Indonesia has legally recognized eSignatures since 2008 with The E-Signature Regulations.

### Summary of Law

Indonesia has a tiered eSignature legal model and recognizes digital signatures as a distinct type of eSignature. Since Indonesia recognizes both electronic and digital signatures, specific standards are put in place for what type of signature is required. The following guidelines must be met for an eSignature to be valid:

- The signature is identifiable and linked to the signatory
- Information used for the signed document can only be controlled by signatory
- Any alterations to the signed document can be detected
- Data that proves signatory’s consent to electronically sign

In some stances when the digital signatures are required, they need to meet the following additional criteria to be equivalent to handwritten signatures:

- Signed document is issued with a digital certificate that is authorized by the Minister of Communications and Informatics

The tiered eSignature legal model in Indonesia allows companies to select the type of eSignatures to use while conducting their business.

### Key Restrictions

- Corporate documents requiring notarization
- HR documents
